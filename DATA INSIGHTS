Key Insights:

1. Loss-Making Segment: While the Technology category leads in sales, some sub-categories (like Tables in Furniture) consistently report low profit or losses, indicating poor margins.

2. Top Performing State/Region: The West region, especially states like California, dominates in both sales and profit, making it a strong candidate for expansion and retention strategies.

3. Low-Performing Region
The South region shows comparatively low sales and profit, indicating an opportunity for regional marketing campaigns or discount-based incentives.

4. Repeat Customers: A significant portion of revenue comes from returning customers in specific cities — loyalty programs can be introduced to enhance customer retention.

5. Shipping Modes and Delivery Impact: Standard Class is the most used shipping mode, but Second Class and Same Day options are growing — could indicate a shift in customer delivery preferences.

6. Product Focus: A few SKUs (specific products) account for large proportions of profit, suggesting that inventory prioritization on high-margin items could increase overall profitability.

7. Discount Impact: Products with frequent high discounts often result in lower profit margins — a discount optimization strategy could protect profits without affecting volume.
